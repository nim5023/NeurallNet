Neural Net AI learning to play dodge-ball


Run as Java Applet  "src/DuelAI2/DuelAI.java"

The large circles are players, the small circles are balls.
The goal is to hit the opposing player with your colored ball.

Training the neural net is a work in progress, in this iteration:
The Red player is learning to dodge throws by the Blue player.
The Blue player is not using a neural net, just collecting and shooting the ball.
